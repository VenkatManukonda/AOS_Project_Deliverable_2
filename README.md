# Deliverable 2: Process Scheduling

## Description
This project implements **Round-Robin** and **Priority-Based** scheduling in a custom shell.  
Processes are simulated with timers, and the shell manages its own ready queue.

- **Round-Robin**: configurable time slice, processes rotated fairly.  
- **Priority-Based**: higher-priority processes run first, with preemption.  

Performance metrics calculated:
- Waiting Time (WT)  
- Turnaround Time (TAT)  
- Response Time (RT)  

## How to Run

python scheduler.py
